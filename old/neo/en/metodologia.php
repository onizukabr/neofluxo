<div id="textos3"><h2>Environment: Twitter</h2><br/>  <p>Although created in 2006, Twitter saw its user base grow from the end of 2008 onwards, becoming the most popular "microblogging" tool on the Web. Besides having features of a social networking website (users can create profiles and interact with others, creating connections and strengthening ties), Twitter may be used for different purposes.</p><br/>  <p>Given this versatility, Twitter is mostly used to share and disseminate information. In addition to its ease of use and speed of its short messages, a sampling of Twitter&#146;s environment can be considered adequate enough to observe the publishing of content related to the electoral process. The growing number of new members, including candidates, campaigners and supporters (spontaneously or not) reinforces this choice.</p><br/>  <p>The choice of this tool also represents a technical advantage: Twitter&#146;s open API allows external developers to create standalone programs that incorporate their services - for example, scanning and collecting data published in public profiles.</p><br/></div>
