<h2>Open Platform</h2><br/>

<p>NeoFluxo compiled databases that represent a broad scope of searches involving the 2010 Presidential election and its impact on the Internet. To widen the performance of these multiple possibilities to the most, access to all data is offered to the community through an open platform, under a Creative Commons license.</p><br/>

<p>This open platform is made possible through an Application Programming Interface, or API. This means that any developer can access data through and establish relationships, create visualizations and thus allow researchersâ€™ inferences on the subject.</p><br/>

<p>Allowing the development of applications and access to data in order to extend the functionality of a system and contribute to its improvement is something rather common in tools such as Twitter and Facebook, but still something largely unexplored by the communication sector - which can now take advantage of available databases from the British newspaper The Guardian (www.guardian.co.uk / data-store) or the U.S. Government (www.data.gov). Far from positioning itself as a pioneer in Brazil, the NeoFluxo project hopes to be one among many similar initiatives in the country.</p><br/>
