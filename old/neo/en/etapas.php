<div id="textos4"><h2>Campaign schedule</h2><br/><p>Although the Internet has been accredited as the &#147;novelty to behold&#148; during this election, since for the first time any citizen could use its tools to express themselves, the electoral TV shows remain as candidates&#146; business cards. It is on TV that strategists and marketers seek to showcase the topics they aim to be discussed by voters - personally or through social networking websites.</p><br/>  <p>This was the criteria defined by the NeoFluxo project to determine information flows. In addition to tracking content published by the official channels, the system made comparisons with terms determined by the researchers. Ten words or expressions were selected for each TV show, per candidate. The choice of words was processed by an adaptation of news value criteria:</p><br/>    <ul>    <li>Continuity</li>    <li>Repetition</li>    <li>Controversy / conflict</li>    <li>Novelty</li>    <li>Dramatization</li>  </ul><br/>    <p>This process was maintained during the runoff vote campaign, but the researchers decided to include a new data collection source: the media scheduling. Twitter messages containing keywords extracted from the four major Web portals in Brazil (UOL, Terra, iG and G1) were stored. This and other data tables form the backbone of NeoFluxo: after collecting and organizing data, you can create applications that can compare them and establish relationships.</p><br/></div>
