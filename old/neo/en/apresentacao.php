<div id="textos1"><h2>Electoral context</h2><br/>  <p>Since the 2008 presidential campaign in the United States, Brazil has been anxiously expecting its 2010 elections hoping to find out who would be this nation&#146;s Barack Obama? That is, which of the candidates to succeed Lula could effectively mobilize voters through social media?</p><br/>  <p>The question makes sense given the growing presence of the voters on the Web. Technological progress, fast data processing, networked communication tools and simple interfaces: these are variables that, combined, allow the expansion of a structure capable of connecting users with ease, and of making them willing to create, share, rate and recommend digital content.</p><br/>  <p>But this web of information, which can be seen with hope by those who value public debate and the fortification of democracy, also carries some distrust and suppositions. After all, it is also possible to see it being used only for the sake of numbers. Entertainment generating audience, which favors advertising formats, for instance.</p><br/>  <p>With that, any assessment regarding the use of social media in the election process, by both voters and campaign strategists, was difficult to qualify. With the end of the election, one of the recurrent impressions is: the Internet has seen its decentralized systems filled by rumors and lies, leaving debate or outreach efforts in the background.</p><br/>  <p>Was it solely that? Why not take advantage of a consistent database, comprising of a significant sampling of content disseminated on the most popular Internet tools, to verify this and other hypotheses? More than that: what about analyzing these data to seek patterns, origins, and thus information flows? This is NeoFluxo&#146;s mission.</p><br/></div>
