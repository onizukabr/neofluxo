<div id="textos2"><h2>What is NeoFluxo?</h2><br/>  <p>The NeoFluxo project, elaborated by the Communication, Technology and Network Culture Research Group (Teccred) from Casper Libero School, with the support of CNPq, was born in the first half of 2010. Its main aim is to identify the behavior of information flow in social networking websites during the Brazilian election process.</p><br/>  <p>At first, the proposal was to monitor all messages related to the two major presidential candidates (Jose Serra / PSDB and Dilma Rousseff / PT) published by their official sources (on Twitter, Facebook and the candidates&#146; websites) and quoted on Twitter by public profiles. With the growth of Marina Silva / PV at the end of the first vote, mentions of her name were also collected and stored in databases, using software built for this purpose.</p><br/>  <p>Data collection was made according to certain keywords determined by the researchers, with reference to proposals presented at the biggest showcase of the electoral campaign in Brazil, where debate is proposed with greater strength: the electoral TV shows. To identify the information flow and determine which messages and guidance from the candidates influenced discussions and points of view, NeoFluxo used Twitter as a base.</p><br/>  <p>Both the keywords selected by the researchers and the material collected from candidate&#146;s official sources allow the mapping of the system: where is the starting point of a particular message, its path and how it was redistributed through Twitter.</p><br/></div>
